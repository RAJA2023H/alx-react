0x06-React_Immutable
Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing immutability in JavaScript, particularly within the context of React applications. Immutability is a key concept that can prevent bugs and improve performance by ensuring that objects and data structures remain unchanged after they are created. The Immutable.js library will be used extensively in this project to bring immutability to JavaScript.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and demonstrate:

Immutable Objects: Understand the concept of immutable objects, why they are important, and how they are used in programming.

Immutable.js Library: Learn how to use the Immutable.js library to enforce immutability in JavaScript applications.

List vs. Map: Distinguish between the List and Map data structures in Immutable.js, and know when to use each.

Merge, Concat, and Deep Merging: Understand and apply the merge, concat, and deep merging techniques with immutable data structures.

Lazy Sequences (Seq): Understand what a lazy sequence (Seq) is in Immutable.js and how it can be used to improve performance.

Project Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
